# Privileges: A Terminal-Based Game
## 1. About the Game
Privileges is a terminal-based game that aims to shed light on societal inequalities and the uneven distribution of opportunities. The game provides insights into different life paths around the world and explores the social prerequisites for good jobs, education, and secure living conditions. The goal is to foster empathy towards social minorities, encourage self-reflection on your societal position, and stimulate a stance of solidarity.

The game is designed to challenge our understanding and dive into the complex dynamics of privilege. It includes a series of questions that players answer based on their real-life experiences or the experiences of a pre-defined character. The game tracks the player's progress based on their answers, providing a visual representation of the privileges (or lack thereof) that they may experience in their life.

##2. Installation
To start the game, you need to run the main.kt file located in the src/main/kotlin directory.

##3. Game Structure and Flow
The game starts with an onboarding process where players choose the language they want to play the game in. The game currently supports Deutsch, English, Türkçe, Polski, and العربية.

After choosing the language, players are presented with a choice to play as themselves or to choose one of the pre-made characters. If they choose to play as themselves, they are encouraged to answer the questions as honestly as possible. If they choose a pre-made character, they are asked to adapt to the role as much as possible and answer the questions based on that role.

The main part of the game consists of a series of questions. For each question, players can answer with 'yes' or 'no'. For each question answered with 'yes', the game takes the player one step forward - for one answered with 'no', the game takes the player a step back.

At the end of the game, players are presented with an evaluation of their answers and are encouraged to reflect on their experiences.

##4. Customization and Further Development
The game is designed to be customizable and extendable. The questions can be adjusted to fit different contexts, and additional languages can be added to make the game more accessible to a wider audience.
